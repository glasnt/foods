    1.  Pour a layer of flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge each chicken piece in flour and tap off excess.
    2. Heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter as it finishes cooking and set aside.
    3. Add vegetables and garlic into the pan, scraping off the fond from the bottom of the pan, and sauté for a few minutes.
    4. Add stock or water to the pot, with tomatoes, herbs, and spices, and bring to a simmer.
    5. Simmer for 30 minutes on the stove top until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thickened. 
    6. Discard herbs and bay leaf, and serve with rice rice or fresh bread.

This recipe freezes really well for when you need some comfort food in a hurry. If freezing, portion one thigh per container, but cut up the thighs before freezing to aid in defrosting. 

This recipe could either be done in a saucepan, or in a dutch oven, where instead of simmering for 30 minutes, place dutch oven in a preheated 180°C oven until the chicken is cooked through.
