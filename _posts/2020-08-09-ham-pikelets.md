Pikelets are such an Australian thing. This receipe works well with leftover Christmas leg ham. 

It's pretty much a varient on Zucchini Fritters, but this time with more flour and less vegetable. The corn is also optional. 

Turns out, putting meat inside pancakes and leaving out the sugar is tasty af.
