If you've never had this type of curry before, it'll be different to what you're expecting. 

The Golden Curry mix used in this dish is a shelf-stable roux block, that is used to flavour and thicken the end result. 

You can learn more about curry in Japan from [this episode of Japanology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pXxAiBG_z4).

While the radish pickles are normally bright red, the neon yellow version I used here are [Tokyo Takuantaro](http://www.kyuchan.co.jp/export/product_information/takuantaro/index.html), and serve the job of cutting through the rich roux perfectly well. 

I normally add a liberal amount of sriracha and [shichimi](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/803610/house-foods-shichimi-togarashi) to give it kick, although it's perfectly fine on it's own.
