    1. Preheat oven to 190Â°C. Brush muffin pans with melted butter to lightly grease. Combine the poppy seeds and 60ml (1/4 cup) of the milk in a small bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes.
    1. Combine the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Add the poppy-seed mixture along with remaining milk, butter, egg, orange rind and juice, and stir with a metal spoon until just combined (do not overmix).

I normally have all the other ingredients on hand at all times, so it's just a case of grabbing a fresh navel orange, and boom! Muffins!

This receipe comes directly from [Taste.com.au](https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/orange-poppy-seed-muffins/97f454c3-d413-4b9f-a437-d5ba985106c0), and is my go-to if I want to bake and freeze treats for later.
