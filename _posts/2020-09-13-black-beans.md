I normally have small cans of black beans on hand if I want to throw some into a quick chilli, but until now I hadn't made a meal out of them. This recipe hit the spot. 

The visual and added flavour of the scallion, green herbs, and capsicum make this dish much less 'boring' than it sounds.

*A note for the Australian localisation of this recipe: the original recipe calls for using the canning liquid in the beans. Edgell Black Beans have minimal liquid, compared to Annalisa which has a lot. Depending on your brand, add more or less water as desired. If they are too liquidy, the 'sauce' will still be tasty and the rice will soak it up well.
