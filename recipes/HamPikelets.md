Serves: 1

* 80g flour

* 1 egg
* 30g ham, sliced
* 1 125g corn kernels, drained
* 10g spring onion, sliced thinly

Mix all ingredients in a bowl, salt and pepper to taste. 

If mixture is too thick and doesn't pour, add more milk to suit.

Lightly oil a frypan, and cook small flat portions until golden brown. 

Serve immediately, with avocado, tomato sauce, or cream cheese.
